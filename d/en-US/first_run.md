## Secure Your Task Proxy Setup

</webui-page-segment>

Welcome! The first step is creating your **Security Key**.

Think of this key as a master password. It's essential because Task Proxy uses it to encrypt and protect any sensitive information (like passwords or API keys) you store in your variables.

### How it works

* You'll create this key now.
* We'll store it securely using your operating system's built-in credential manager (like Keychain on macOS or Credential Manager on Windows).

### **Important: Back Up Your Key!**

We strongly recommend saving a copy of your Security Key somewhere safe, like a password manager. This backup is crucial if:

* Your key gets removed from your system's storage.
* You need to move your Task Proxy data to a new computer.
