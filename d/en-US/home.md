Welcome to Task Proxy! Your development tool for managing your documentation and scripts alongside productivity features to help organize, simplify, and automate your workflows.

The primary concept for Task Proxy is to provide users with a tool where they can easily create and manage project documentation, scripts, and configurations.

## Features currently being ported from our Legacy App

````section

- Account Login
- Create unique Task Proxy Projects for each project you need.
- Quickly and easily switch between projects within Task Proxy.
- Manage project README.md files with live display.
- Create and manage Task Proxy Pages within a project that can store multiple modules you setup to provide documentation, run scripts, show reports, and more.
- Manage and store secrets to use in scripts and API connections securely by encrypting them and storing them outside of any projects.
- Scope data to Global, Project, or Page to determine if it can be used across all projects, only within the current project, or only within the current page.
- Task Proxy pages are stored within the project folder [projectroot]/.taskproxy so pages stay with the project and are easily synced and shared along with project updates - when using version control such as Git or Mercurial.
- Command flows that allow running specified scripts and apis in a specified sequence.

## Planned Features

- Terminal module that will allow running scripts that need to run continuously and not be restricted to only running when the hosting page is open.
